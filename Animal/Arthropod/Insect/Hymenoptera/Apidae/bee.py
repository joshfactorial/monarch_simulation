class Bee(Pollinator):
    """
    This class will establish some baselines for all types of bees. There are a huge diversity of native and commercial
    bees. The most common bees that people tend to be interested in are the Western honey bee (Apis mellifera) and some
    related species (such as the hybrid 'Africanized honey bee', a cross between A. mellifera and an African
    subspecies), and Bombus impatiens, a domesticated bumble bee. However, there has been a growing interest in native
    bees, such as the wide range of Bombus spp. and solitary bees. Bees generally have a home base, either a nest
    or a hive. Bombus and many solitary bees tend to nest in the ground, while A. mellifera have hives, either in rocky
    areas or trees. We'll try to allow for a diversity of options. Crop fields are generally sprayed with pesticides and
    trampled with farm equipment, so it's less common to find bees nesting in the fields themselves. In general we'll
    consider bees won't wander too far frm their home. Doing so would mean certain death (honey bee and bumble bee
    drones and queens would be the exception, since they leave their nests to start new colonies and breed. I'll focus
    on just the workers and for the general bee I'll assume it can exit, but at a very low chance.
