        The idea here is to simulate one day in the life of a pollinator. For convenience, one loop will represent 25

        of pen-and-paper rpgs. I'll create class-specific methods to define the actual actions taken, but basically
        I'll divide the day into early morning, late mornning, noonish, early afternoon, late afternoon, and night.
        Because pollinator_types all rely on flowers, they tend to be most active early and later in the day, preferring to
        shelter when the day is hottest, and all rest at night when the flowers are more or less dormant. This
        should allow me to generalize a day of a pollinator and get more specific in their pollinator_types. I'll assume a
        day runs from 4am to the next 4am, though a pollinator could jump into this method at any time. Those entering
        later will get a pro-rated day, though the assumption is the wrapper will run the sim until they die or leave,
        so not getting a full day for the first day shouldn't hurt them overall.
